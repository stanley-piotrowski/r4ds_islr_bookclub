# README

This repository contains notes, code, and worked examples from the Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R (2<sup>nd</sup> edition) textbook by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani (link to a PDF copy of the textbook can be found [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf)).  All of the datasets used in the textbook are distributed in the [ISLR2 package](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ISLR2/index.html) on CRAN.  Note, there are a few additional datasets presented in the textbook that are not distributed in the ISLR2 package (e.g.,  `Income` in Chapter 2).  These datasets can be found on the textbook website [here](https://www.statlearning.com/resources-second-edition).
